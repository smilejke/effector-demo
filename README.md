This project was created as demonstration of Effector state manager.\
A lot of decisions were made only to demonstrate different Effector's possibilities and could have been done much easier.\
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:smilejke/effector-demo.git`
2. `cd effector-demo/`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

## Author's advice

Look through the project in logical order for better understanding:

<ol>
<li>menu</li>
<li>cart</li>
<li>orders</li>
<li>map</li>
</ol>
Each feature block contain files to work with Effector, I also advice to learn them in such an order:  
<ol>
<li>stores</li>
<li>controllers</li>
<li>model</li>
<li>init</li>
<li>selectors</li>
</ol>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run test`

Runs the application tests.\
App contain only few tests just to show Effector's test advantages.
